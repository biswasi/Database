first_name: user's first name;second_name: user's last name; attribute: a unique attribute string of this user.
It seems that only the users those attribute was generated by the old version of your special algorithm were affected. Such attributes have the following format (accurate to letter cases): <one or more arbitrary character>%<first name>_<second name>%<zero or more arbitrary characters>. 
It's your duty now to warn the users that have these attributes about possible risks.*/
